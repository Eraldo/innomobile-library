## Commit Message Format

Based on Ionic:

`type(scope): subject`

#### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **fix**: A bug fix
* **feat**: A new feature
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests

#### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example, the name of the plugin being changed

#### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* do not capitalize first letter
* do not place a period (.) at the end
* entire length of the commit message must not go over 50 characters
